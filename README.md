# Udemy QA 1

This project contains exercises from the first Udemy course I took on *test automation*.

This is just a repository where I can save my files and access whenever needed. Files presented here were developed by the lecturer Jose Salvatierra and implemented by me through their directions and guidance. Some files, such as those related to REST API systems were handed by the lecturer and are used merely as a support for test development.

The project is organised by lectures:
- **Python recap** where we get familiarised with Python, the coding language used in this course;
- **Unit and integration tests**;
- **Flask**;
- **Testing an API** using unit and integration tests;
- **Automation** tools and techniques, like Selenium.
